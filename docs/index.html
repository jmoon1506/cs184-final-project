<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>For this project, we hope to implement 2D global illumination. Our most ambitious goal is to use Global Line Radiosity, which has been shown to render realistic scenes in real-time. Failing that, we could implement a Monte Carlo pathtracer similar to the one in Assignment 3 - with the added ability to see samples added in real-time.</p>

			Lawrence Elkins: TODO(SID)
			</li>
			<br/><br/>
		</ul>
		<li>TODO: Problem Description</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>TODO: Goals and Deliverables</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This is the most important part of your proposal. You should carefully think through what you are trying to accomplish, what results you are going for, and why you think you can accomplish those goals. For example:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Since this is a graphics class you will likely define the kind of images you will create (e.g. including a photo of a new lighting effect you will simulate).</li>
				<li>Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try.</li>
				<li>What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?</li>
			</ul>
			<li>You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In (1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect (i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan).</li>
		</ul>
		<li>TODO: Schedule</li>
		<ul>
			<li>In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>TODO: Resources</li>
		<ul>
			<li>List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer to it here.</li>
		</ul>

<!-- TODO:
I. 2D simplifications
  a. Only need to sample pixels on the 2D plane
  b. Only need to cast rays in 360 degrees, instead of an entire sphere
I. Global Line Radiosity
  1. Discuss parallel ray-bundling
    a. Each sample calculates radiosity equation at every pixel, but with rays all in the same direction
    b. Sampling many times, with many solid angles, yields the equivalent result to raytracing
    c. Essentially rasterizes with each sample, making better use of GPU than raytracing
  3. Other considerations
    a. Possibly use raymarching and distance functions instead of primitives and intersection tests
    b. Cheap soft shadows, sub-surface scattering, ambient occlusion
II. Monte Carlo Pathtracer
  1. 2D changes
    a. Rays deposit light along their path
  2. Downsides
    a. Adjusting the camera or scene requires resampling the entire image
    b. Runs on CPU, or inefficiently on GPU
    c. Not truly real-time, impractical for actual applications
    d. Line deposition not physically-based, doesn't looks realistic unless we have a ridiculous number of samples
  3. Upsides
    a. Easier to render caustics and specular surfaces
IV. Add related works
