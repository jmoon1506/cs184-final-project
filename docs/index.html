    <h2>Title, Summary and Team Members</h2>
  </div>
		<p>For this project, we hope to implement 2D global illumination. We will start out by implementing a Monte Carlo pathtracer similar to the one in Assignment 3 - with the added ability to see samples added in real-time. Our most ambitious goal is to use Global Line Radiosity, which has been shown to render realistic scenes in real-time.

      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    </div>

		<p>Our idea is to run 2D real-time global illumination. Ray tracing is a powerful method, and it is important because it generates realistic scenes. For 3D space, the main challenge is running it in real-time because it is too costly. There are several components to us solving this issue of high cost:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Run the renderer in 2D space instead of 3D space to decrease complexity.</li>
			<li>When objects or light in the scene move, there is a chance we might need to slightly decrease the smoothness and increase the noise for a little bit until we are able to achieve higher quality. We, of course, want to avoid this as much as we can, but if it comes down to it, we might need to.</li>
			<li>More ambitiously, we want to run Global Line Radiosity on the GPU, likely using OpenCL (TODO: Joseph are we set on OpenCL or should we mention using WebGL instead?). </li>
		</ul>

      <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
    </div>
		<ul>
			<li>TODO: from spec: "Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try."</li>
			<li>TODO: from spec: "What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?"</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>What we plan to deliver: Real-time 2D Monte Carlo Path Tracing</h3>
    </div>
			<ul>
				<li>Render simple 2D scenes in real-time (limited number of lights and objects).</li>
				<li>To show that our renderer is in real-time, we will need to have the scene either be animating/changing in real-time or have the ability to interact with it.</li>
        <li>We will initially try the radiosity equation from class. If that doesn't work, then we will just deposit light along rays and adjust gamma (like in <a href="https://benedikt-bitterli.me/tantalum/tantalum.html">this resource</a>).</li>
				<li>In this implementation, we will sort of "lazy load" (TODO: Is this a good idea to refer to it as lazy loading, or do you think we shouldn't?) the scene after movements. This means that the quality of the real-time render might start out a bit noisy when things are first moved. For example: </li>

        <li>Downsides</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Adjusting the camera or scene requires resampling the entire image, which is costly.</li>
          <li>Runs on CPU, or inefficiently on GPU</li>
          <li>Not truly real-time because of the quality of the rendering after movement. Impractical for actual applications</li>
          <li>Line deposition not physically-based, doesn't looks realistic unless we have a ridiculous number of samples</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Upsides</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Easier to render caustics and specular surfaces</li>
